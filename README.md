### Overview
The purpuse of this analysis was to determine the viability of a surf/ice cream shop on Oahu based on weather patterns.

###Results
*You really couldn't pick a better place to open an ice cream or surfing business. Tempuratures stay fairly mild throughout the year.
*In June the average temperature was a pleasant 74 degrees but never got hotter than 85. Not too hot to surf and plenty hot enough for ice cream.
*In December the temperature only drops 3 or 4 degrees across all categories, with 75% of temperatures never dropping below 69.
